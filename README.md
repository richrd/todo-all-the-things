# todo-all-the-things
A list of projects I would like to do. Ideas that I feel strongly about. I want to do "all the things" but this repo mainly includes stuff that I think I'll actually do one day.

Sorry, currently most of these projects are only in progress. :(


## Done

 * pyco_http - My own super light weight HTTP server written in Python
 > * Check it out: https://github.com/richrd/pyco-http
 > * It's small and has no dependecies
 > * Only implements the HTTP protocol
 > * Meant for adding web based features to Python apps
 > * Provides simple request objects via a callback for each request
 > * Allows easy responding to the requests
 > * So minimal that you might want to create your own wrapper for it

## In Progress

Not all listed features are implemented, but I intend to get them done at some point.

 * BX2 - A fully custom modular IRC bot written in Python.
 > * Current version: https://github.com/richrd/bx
 > * New (dev) version: https://github.com/richrd/bx2
 > * Supports user accounts with different permissions
 > * Modules that implement features including: pasting channel logs, auto-opping, maintaining channel modes, weather, calculator, etc...
 > * Command aliases
 > * Reload bot code while still staying in IRC
 > * Extendable with custom modules

 * Endless Void - An asteroids like MMO with vast space to explore
 > * A HTML5 game slightly resemblibg arcade Asteroids
 > * Multi player with a vast space to explore and conquer
 > * Stars with obiting planets
 > * Asteroids
 > * Pickups
 > * **Will require lots of work implementing the node.js server etc**
 > * The concept is big! Check out the readme at https://github.com/richrd/endlessvoid

 * Bulk File Renamer
 > * Yeah this has also been done a million times, but sorry, I wanted my own.
 > * Needs improvements but check out the current version at (https://github.com/richrd/renamer)


## On Hold (havent started work or a repo yet)

 * AirRead - A simple app for extracting "important" data from recorded Wi-Fi traffic.
 > * Yeah it's done before, but I've done it again for fun.
 > * Extracts HTTP Auth logins, FTP credentials and other important stuff from captured wifi traffic.
 > * I have a simple version of this but it must be cleaned before GitHub exposure.

 * MultiMap - A map showing many layers including real time public transport etc.
 > * All real time public transport info in Finland.
 > * All restaurants from "eat.fi".
 > * All available emergency incidents in Finland.
 > * Any other relevant data sources that I can think of

 * Alchohol 'counter' - Simple web app for college students etc for tracking alcohol consumption
 > * Calculates the number of alcohol units consumed based on given input.
 > * Supports adding drinks with a custom size and alcohol volume.
 > * Shows the total amount of units consumed.
 > * Warns when the user has had too much in a short time.
